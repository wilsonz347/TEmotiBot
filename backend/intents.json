It usually has a clear cause, such as a deadline or a significant life change, and symptoms often subside once the stressful situation is resolved. In contrast, anxiety can be more complex; it involves persistent worries or fears about potential threats, which may not always be identifiable. Anxiety can also include apprehension about experiencing anxiety itself, leading to a cycle of worry. While both stress and anxiety are normal human experiences, they can become problematic if they persist over time or significantly impact our well-being and daily functioning. Understanding these differences can help in managing each condition effectively."]
